# Continuous Delivery Terminology Timeline

The purpose of this doc is to record the timeline of when important terminology in
the Continuous Delivery came into being.

See [definitions](definitions.md) for the CDF's definitions of these terms.

This is meant to be a living document: if you have additional information on the
origins of these phrases, [please open a PR](CONTRIBUTING.md)!

\* Canonical indicates that these works were particularly impactful on the narrative
   in the CD community, e.g. created the phrases we use today
