# Continuous Delivery Terminology Timeline

The purpose of this doc is to record the timeline of when important terminology in
the Continous Delivery came into being.

This is not meant to be the definitivie definitions of each of these terms (watch
this repo!)

This is meant to be a living document: if you have additional information on the
origins of these phrases, [please open a PR](CONTRIBUTING.md)!

\* Canonical indicates that these works were particularly impactful on the narrative
   in the CD community, e.g. created the phrases we use today
